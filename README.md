1. Software Needed

Eclipse IDE: Use the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" (or "Enterprise Edition").

Apache Tomcat: Version 9.0 is recommended.

Oracle Database: Oracle Express Edition (XE) 11g or 21c is perfect.

2. Add Oracle JDBC Driver

This allows Java to connect to your Oracle database.

Download the Oracle JDBC Driver (e.g., ojdbc11.jar or ojdbc8.jar).

In your Eclipse project, create a folder: src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib

Drag and drop the .jar file you downloaded into this lib folder.
